# streamlit4ML
The main objective of this repository is making a sence about how  ML's models and its parameters  effect to data.

## Our workflow
* First we need to define our objective:
  + We try to create a tool to suport students who learning ML. It makes this subject become easy than more.
  + In primary stage, we focus on create available ML models  and evaluation method. Then create a tool to analyst data. 
  + Additional, we will try to implement model by several framework such as: Pytorch, Tensorflow, MXNet, ..
  + Target: Which model should by choose? Which parameters should be choose?
  
* Next stage is about datasets: this available from nttuan8, machinelearningcoban
* In select algoritm, we choose: Linear regesion, Losgitic, SVM, Random Tree, ...
* Build model by: Pytorch, Tensorflow, MXNet,.. 
* Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, ...
* Deploy: Streamlit sharing.
